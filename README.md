# Machine Learning Project Structure

Having a well-organized general Machine Learning project structure makes it easy to understand and make changes. Moreover, this structure can be the same for multiple projects, which avoids confusion. 

## Steps involved in making a project Structure

Step 01: Make sure that you have latest python and pip installed in your system.

Step 02: Create a sample repository on github.com (For example: Machine-Learning-Project)

Step 03: Clone the repo in your local system `git clone <url>`

Step 04: Change directory to new directory 'Machine-Learning-Project' `cd Machine-Learning-Project`

Step 05: Create and activate virtaul environment
```
Example 01:

- Create Virtual Environment
    python -m venv venv_machine_learning_project
    
- Activate Created Virtual Environment
    For unix based system -> source ./venv_machine_learning_project/bin/activate 
    For windows -> ./venv_machine_learning_project/Scripts/activate 

Example 02: 

- Create Virtual Environment
    conda create -n venv_machine_learning_project

- Activate Created Virtual Environment
    conda activate venv_machine_learning_project 
```
Step 06: Follow the below directory structure for your project
